# NextJ2ME

NextJ2ME is a community fork of [J2ME Loader](https://github.com/nikita36078/J2ME-Loader), a J2ME (Java ME) emulator for Android. It keeps everything the original does and focuses on three things:

- **New features** that help people who play, study and debug J2ME games.
- **Performance**: faster, lighter emulation and tools that stay out of the way when they are not used.
- **Bug fixes**: problems found while using the emulator, fixed and kept covered by tests where possible.

> NextJ2ME is an independent fork. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by the authors of J2ME Loader.

## What is new in this fork

### Memory Debugger

A built-in tool to scan, watch, edit and freeze the state of a running game. J2ME Loader has no VM of its own (games are converted to DEX and run on ART), so the debugger works on the **real Java state of the game**: it never shows host pointers or Android process memory.

Turn it on in **Settings → Developer / Debugging** (off by default). Then open it from the toolbar while a game is running.

- **Scan sources:** Raw memory (a virtual big-endian address space built from the game's primitive arrays), Java objects, Primitive arrays and Static fields.
- **Value types:** int8, uint8, int16, uint16, int32, uint32, int64, uint64, float, double, boolean, string and raw bytes.
- **Scan modes:** exact value, unknown initial value, changed / unchanged, increased / decreased (optionally by an amount), equal / not equal to, and **group scan** (find several values that sit together, such as a score next to lives).
- **Any integer size (fuzzy scan):** search a whole number without knowing whether the game stores it as 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits. One pass finds it at every size it fits and lists every address together with its size; the next scans filter all sizes together until only the right one is left.
- **Scan history:** go back to the results of any earlier scan step.
- **Memory view:** List and Hex views, change the data type on the fly, and jump to an address from a scan result or a watch.
- **Edit and freeze:** write a new value, or keep a value fixed while the game runs.
- **Watch list:** keep an eye on values and open any of them in the memory view.
- **Per-game persistence:** watches, frozen values and scan settings are saved separately for each game.
- **Memory safety:** scans are capped, history is trimmed when memory runs low and the user is told when results are dropped, so the debugger does not take the game down.

### One folder per game

Everything that belongs to a game is in one folder of the work folder, split by how precious it is:

```
games/<game>/
    app/        the installed game: converted.dex, res.jar, icon (can be rebuilt)
    saves/      the game's saves: the default slot, and slots/<name>
    config/     the game's settings and key layout
    debugger/   the memory debugger's data for the game
```

Deleting a game removes this one folder. Reinstalling replaces only `app/`, so saves and settings are never touched. Backups pick the parts they need from every game. Profiles (`templates/`), the shared file system (`fs/`), `shaders/` and `cache/` stay at the top level.

### Save slots

Each game can keep several named save slots, for example one per player or one before a hard level. Long-press a game and choose **Save slots**: the slot marked ● is the one the game uses, and you can make a new slot (empty or a copy of the current saves), switch slots, duplicate, rename and delete them. The game picks its slot when it starts, so nothing is copied when you switch, and nothing can be changed while the game is open. The saves of a game live in `games/<game>/saves/`: the "Default" slot is that folder itself, and the slots you make are in its `slots` subfolder. Slots are included in backups, and "Clear data" clears only the slot in use.

### Frame generation (experimental)

For games that cap their own frame rate (for example 20-30 fps), the per-game setting **Frame generation** shows extra pictures between the frames the game draws, so the motion looks smoother on a 60 Hz screen. The game itself is not sped up or changed, only what is shown.

- **Off**: normal drawing.
- **Blend**: cross-fades between the last two game frames. Cheap.
- **Motion**: finds how each part of the picture moved between the two frames and moves it along before blending. Smoother, uses more CPU.
- **Motion HQ**: like Motion, but measures the motion on 8x8 pixel blocks at full size, to a quarter of a pixel, and follows faster movement (up to 32 pixels per frame). Smoothest and sharpest; uses the most CPU and GPU.

**Frame generation rate** sets how many pictures per second are shown: the screen's refresh rate (the default), or 60, 90 or 120 fps. 90 and 120 fps ask Android to run the screen that fast, on phones whose screens can (otherwise it draws as fast as the screen goes). A rate that does not divide the screen's rate, such as 90 fps on a 120 Hz screen, is shown as evenly as the screen allows.

With Motion and Motion HQ, the switch **Clean edges around moving objects** (off by default) also searches the motion backward, from the new frame to the old one. Where the two directions disagree, background is being covered or uncovered by a moving object; those pixels are taken from the one frame where they can be seen, instead of being cross-faded with the object, so moving objects keep clean edges without a halo. It doubles the CPU used for the motion search.

With Motion and Motion HQ, the switch **Search motion on the GPU** (experimental, off by default) moves the motion search from the CPU to the graphics chip: the same steps as Motion HQ's search (quarter-size coarse search, 8x8 blocks refined to a quarter pixel, smoothing), done in OpenGL ES 2.0 shaders, with the result staying on the GPU. It frees the CPU and removes the delay the CPU search adds. If a phone's GPU can not run it, the CPU searches as before.

With Motion and Motion HQ, the switch **Use several CPU cores for motion** (on by default) shares the motion search between up to four cores: the same pictures, worked out two to three times sooner, which lowers the added delay and helps Motion HQ keep up. Switch it off to save battery.

It needs the graphics mode **HW acceleration (OpenGL ES)** (the default) and adds about one game frame of delay. If the device cannot run it, the game falls back to normal drawing.

### 3D resolution (Mascot Capsule, experimental)

The per-game setting **3D resolution** renders the 3D scene of Mascot Capsule games at 2x or 3x the game's size and averages it down, so polygon edges are smooth instead of jagged. The game still sees a picture of its own size, so this smooths edges but does not add detail or sharpen textures. It costs fill rate: 3x draws nine times as many pixels. If the device can not allocate the larger buffer, the game falls back to the normal size. With the setting on **Normal** (the default) nothing changes.

It does not cover M3G (JSR-184) games, or games that draw their 3D with their own software code.

### Built-in shaders

The shader list (graphics mode **HW acceleration (OpenGL ES)**) has five filters that need no files in the shaders folder. Each has sliders behind the tune button next to the list.

- **Smooth upscale**: keeps the game's pixels crisp and smooths only their borders (sharp bilinear), with an optional mix of Catmull-Rom bicubic scaling. A good default for most games.
- **Pixel art (corner smoothing)**: rounds the corners of blocky pixels (Scale2x rules) before scaling. For 2D games with sprites.
- **FXAA (3D edges)**: smooths jagged polygon edges in 3D games. Best with screen filtering on.
- **Sharpen**: an unsharp mask measured in screen pixels, to counter the softness of upscaling. Strength, radius and edge overshoot.
- **Retro screen**: scan lines and a pixel grid (they fade out when the picture is scaled up less than about 2x), plus saturation and gamma.

Only one shader can be used at a time. Shaders from the shaders folder still work as before.

### Backup and restore

**Settings → Backup and restore** saves your data to a single zip file and loads it back. The file is chosen with Android's system file picker, so no storage permission is needed and it can be stored anywhere: internal storage, an SD card or a cloud-backed folder.

- **Saves and settings** (small): game saves, per-game settings, profiles, virtual keyboard layouts and debugger data.
- **Everything** (large): the above plus the installed games.
- Restoring checks the file first, asks for confirmation and overwrites files with the same names; other files are left alone. Files are written through a temporary name, so a failure never leaves a half-written file.
- A backup is a plain zip file; you can open it on a computer.

### Branding

New launcher icon (light style), app name and About screen that credit the original project.

## Roadmap

This is the direction of the project, not a list of finished work. Ideas and bug reports are welcome.

- Performance work on rendering and input handling, measured on real games before and after.
- Bug fixes for games that are reported as broken on the compatibility lists.
- More translations for the new screens.

## Building

You need Android Studio (or the Android SDK with a JDK) and the Android NDK, because the project contains native code.

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleDevDebug
```

Run the unit tests (including the Memory Debugger tests) with:

```bash
./gradlew :app:testDevDebugUnitTest
```

## Contributing

Bug reports, feature requests and pull requests are welcome through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ksdevla/NextJ2ME/issues). When you report a bug, please include the game name, your Android version and device, and the steps to reproduce it. For changes to the debugger, please add or update a test in `app/src/test/java/ru/playsoftware/j2meloader/debugger/`.
